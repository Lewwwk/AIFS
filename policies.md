### Proposals

#### What can proposals do?

Proposals are request for community consent, and can result in an update to the [DAO State document](https://github.com/Lewwwk/AIFS). Here are some things that proposals can do:

1. Request/allocate Treasury funds.
2. Alter [Permissions](./permissions.md).
3. Add, remove, update [Policies](./policies.md).
4. Update DAO State in any other way.

#### Proposal Process

- Any member of the Telegram group may request community conensus using a Telegram Poll and 'Fist to Five' vote (see below).
- If there are more votes than the greater of 10 or 10% of the Telegram members, the vote can be closed by any member documenting the current state of the Poll, in a reply message to that Poll and requesting it be recorded to the DAO state.
- If the proposal is passed, the `DAO State Updater` will document the vote and required changes in [Approvals](./approvals.md), implement the changes, and commit the new DAO state to record.

#### Fist to Five Voting

Fist to Five Voting is a simple voting mechanism to provide more nuanced expressions of consensus. Voters use the following scale.

- Fist - 'This proposal is not safe to try.'
- One - 'I strongly object to this proposal as written.'
- Two - 'I have concerns that need to be heard.'
- Three - 'I have concerns or improvements, but could probably live with it.'
- Four - 'I support this proposal and think it could be improved.'
- Five - 'I completely support this proposal as written.'

Proponents should endeavour to bring all voters to a vote of three or higher. No proposal may pass with any Fist votes recorded.
