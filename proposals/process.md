# Proposals

### What can proposals do?

Proposals are an update on the DAO State document ([this](https://github.com/Krause-House/org)). Here are some things that proposals can do:

1. Request/allocate Treasury funds.
2. Alter [Permissions Roster](./permissions).
3. Adding, removing, updating [norms](./norms.md). 
4. Update DAO State in any other way.

### Proposal Process

1. Any NFT holder can submit a proposal to Stewards Team.
2. Stewards Team validates proposals to move to Snapshot.
3. $KRAUSE holders vote on Snapshot via token-weighted voting.
4. If passing, multisig points ENS field to a git commit hash or IPFS link.
